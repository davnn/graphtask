Ensemble Learning
-----------------

Ensemble learning methods combine multiple machine learning methods to obtain better predictive performance than any
of the constituent algorithms alone. The following examples show how you can easily implement powerful ensemble
learning models using graphtask and `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_.
